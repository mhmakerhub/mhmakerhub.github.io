<p class="mb-5 px-5">
    Show-Ask-Make, or SAM, is our monthly event series where we hang out and talk shop. Want advice 
    on a project? Looking to show off your latest progress? Or simply interested in chatting about the latest
    tools and machines? Show-Ask-Make is the place! 
</p>
<p class="mb-5 px-5">
    Show-Ask-Make is usually held at a small studio workspace in Newburgh rented by Makerdale member Jonas. You
    can bring your own equipment to work on your project. There is also some limited equipment at the studio that
    you can use with advance permission from Jonas, such as 3d printers, CNC machines, and a very cool laser lathe
    that Jonas built himself. Any questions about the event? Drop us a line via the contact form at the bottom of this
    page or via an email to <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a>.
